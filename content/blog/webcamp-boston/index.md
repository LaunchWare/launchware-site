So my Irish pride got the best of me and I missed last month's <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBoston2">BarCamp 2</a>. <a href="http://www.somedirection.com">Kyle</a> pointed me toward <a href="http://webcampboston.com/events/event-june-16-2007">WebCamp</a> which is set to happen for June 16, 2007. I'm planning on attending. I hope to see you there. I really enjoyed BarCamp Manchester and I've been trying to make it to another "unconference." They're great, donation based get togethers with web professionals and other techies/entrepreneurs. I highly recommend checking one out if it's well attended. I hope to see you there.
