[Jon Follett](http://www.hotknifedesign.com) and I did a lightning talk on swooping in to save projects from epic failure at [Ignite Boston 5](http://ignite.oreilly.com/2009/01/ignite-boston-5.html). It seems to be a topic that the audience had an interest in. We looked at our experiences and set out to provide some useful tips.

We had 5 minutes to get our points across. It was challenging but fun. It was a great event and there were lots of other great talks. 

The slides are below.

To place further emphasis on the message - communication is a vital part of every project. We've inherited so many projects going wrong just because people aren't being honest and open with each other. Communicate to educate, define norms, and demonstrate progress. These are not nice to haves in your projects - they're requirements.
