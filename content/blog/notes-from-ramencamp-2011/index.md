Congratulations to the organizers of [Ramencamp](http://ramencamp.com/), a new Boston conference for bootstrapping your startup. The content was amazing and it was a great crowd of Boston professionals.

I've been playing around with [SpringPad](http://springpadit.com/) and thought it would be cool to share my notebook from the day. [Check out my notes](http://sprng.me/aiug4).

After using SpringPad on my iPad for the day, I can see myself taking notes at other conferences in this way. I've really been enjoying the application, and I recommend you check it out. I also dig the Android app.

Another great idea the organizers incorporated into the agenda were lunch conversations with all of the speakers. It was a great way to facilitate a more interactive chat. The highlight of the day for me was watching [Elizabeth Yin](http://twitter.com/launchbit) guide business oriented founders towards not rushing to build products and to make small steps towards building complex feature sets. She did a phenomenal job expressing [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) sentiments in a simple and understandable manner. Launchbit has done a great job assembling a toolkit for founders to assess their business ideas. I definitely recommend checking out the [Launchbit](http://www.launchbit.com/index.php) site.
