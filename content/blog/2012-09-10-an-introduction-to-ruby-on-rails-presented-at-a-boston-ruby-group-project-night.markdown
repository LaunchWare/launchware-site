I've recently begun presenting an Introduction to Rails Workshop at [BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org) Project Nights. They've been a lot of fun and I plan to continue facilitating workshops at future project nights. We recorded the video from our last, remote session, and made it available on YouTube.

If you're interested in learning about Rails or getting to know the BostonRB community, the project nights are a lot of fun. We've gotten great feedback, and we're looking forward to improving them over time. The project nights are on the first Tuesday of every month and we're thankful to the great team at [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) for hosting us.

At LaunchWare, helping others advance is [core to our values](/about). We find that teaching is not only rewarding, but also helps to solidify our knowledge. We're [currently hiring](/careers), and we're looking for developers that are eager to contribute to our wonderful Boston Ruby community in such meaningful ways. If you're someone that loves to learn and give back, be sure to [check out our careers page](/careers).
