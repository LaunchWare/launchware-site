I've absolutely fallen in love with Podcasts. Here's why: I spend a lot of time on the road and I feel like driving is an absolute waste of valuable time. My good friend and I were planning a road trip for the weekend so I scoured the net for some decent podcasts. I've posted my favorites <a title="Podcasts" href="/links#podcasts">here</a>. The six hour round trip was spent learning about project management and entrepreneurial subject matter. I came home from the trip extremely excited to put some of that knowledge to work.
There's so much free information on the web. Apple has a great <a title="ITunes Podcasting Guide" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/tutorials/itunes/it5-1.html">getting started guide</a> on how to tap into these resources.

If you haven't learned it yet, you'll quickly find that as an entrepreneur your time is a valuable commodity. If you have a passion for learning and you spend a lot of time on the road, I highly recommend using <a title="ITunes" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">ITunes</a> and your MP3 Player to listen to podcasts while driving.
