So today I attended:

* **Keynote** - [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) is pretty entertaining, but I didn't get a lot of substance out of his talk. He touched upon keeping users happy and what it take to do it. Overall, a humorous way to kick things off.
* **Entrepreneurs on Rails** - this was really inspiring. [Dan Benjamin](http://www.hivelogic.com) shared his experiences and some of the pitfalls. It was great to get some insight from someone that's walked the path I've wanted to: start off as a service oriented business and break out into some product based businesses.
* **10 Things I Hate About Web Apps** - I honestly wish I attended a different presentation. The end was ok, as the speaker introduced [LimeLight](http://limelight.8thlight.com/) - it looks like it could compete with AIR - what I liked is that it runs on JRuby - so anything with a JVM can run it.
* **Faster, Better ORM with DataMapper** - this was probably the highlight of the day. I really think DataMapper could be a replacement for ActiveRecord in the Rails framework. I've played with it when I was looking at [merb](http://www.merbivore.com). Better handling for legacy databases, eager and lazy loading. When version 1.0 comes out in the Summer, I will definitely look at it as a primary Ruby ORM.
* **Flexible Scaling** - this was a great talk. I've been playing with Amazon EC2 (a scalable way to create infrastructure/hosts), but now I'm even more intrigued. What's interesting is that the speaker is hosting his database cluster off of the cloud
* **UI On Rails** - Connecting Designers and Developers - I was kind of disappointed with this one. It seemed like it surprised a lot of people to give Designers access to source code, but [Kyle](http://www.somedirection.com) seems to handle it without issue.

Overall it's been a fun day, but man am I exhausted. My favorite session was definitely the one on DataMapper. I'm hoping Rails adds similar ORM options and configuration like Merb.
