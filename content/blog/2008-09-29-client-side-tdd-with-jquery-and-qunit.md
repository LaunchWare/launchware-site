For a while now, I've been looking for a solid framework to make assertions around my client side code. In my move from [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) to [jquery](http://jquery.com/), I've begun to use JSON a lot more as responses to my AJAX requests. Because I'm not returning markup anymore, there is some logic in the presentation layer of my apps. 

Thanks to [Chad Myers](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/08/28/getting-started-with-jquery-qunit-for-client-side-javascript-testing.aspx) for his simple intro to [qUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit) - I will definitely be trying it out in a few of my projects.
