<p>If you're wondering what's up with <a href="http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml" title="Ruby-Amazon">Ruby-Amazon</a>, it is actually based on Amazon Web Service's 3.1 version. I was playing with it earlier this week and realized there was a ton of missing data. So I've migrated some of my apps to <a href="http://www.pluitsolutions.com/projects/amazon-ecs" title="Amazon-ECS">Amazon-ECS</a> as a result. I have to say I'm pretty impressed with the library as it allows you to flexibly integrate with new versions of Amazon's platform. There was some effort in integrating a different library but if you're familiar with <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">Hpricot</a> it should be a snap. I'm not sure why Herryanto built it with Hpricot, as I'm a <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a> fan myself.</p>
<p>I totally dig <a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Commerce-Service-AWS-home-page/b?ie=UTF8&node=12738641&tag=ensolinc-20">Amazon's platform</a> though. It really allows affiliates to add value to Amazon's site.</p>
