[Mike Denomy](https://twitter.com/mdenomy) and [Johnny Boursiquot](https://twitter.com/jboursiquot) have been doing a great job organizing workshops and small talks as we continue to improve [Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org) project nights.

Mike asked a few of us to speak about a selection of five of our favorite ruby gems as a way to expose beginners to some great libraries. You can find all the talks on the [BostonRB presentation listing](http://bostonrb.org/presentations). [Jason Draper](https://github.com/drapergeek) also delivered a great talk on [writing your first integration tests](http://bostonrb.org/presentations/introduction-to-integration-testing) that I definitely recommend checking out!

Video and slides from my presentation are below.
