At long last, EnlightSolutions.com looks like a professional website. Please check out some of the new features and content.

I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.ejaedesign.com/index.php/journal">Jae Barclay</a> for his phenomenal brand work as well as for the site's conceptual design.

At a later date, I'll post a little more detail on how I worked the whole design.

For now, I'm thrilled with the new site.  I hope that you are, too. Please let me know what you think (both as far as the design and the content is concerned).
