I'm a huge fan of getting things done and constantly honing my productivity. I recommend that everyone should learn about different methodologies and blend them together into your own.  It takes a unique and different approach for everyone to score their goals. The triple deke might have worked for the Mighty Ducks,

But, for me, I use a mix of things I've learned from these books:

* [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253296979&sr=8-1&tag=ensolinc-20) - David Allen's analysis and structured system around productivity is a must read for those that want to boost their productivity
* [The Ultimate Sales Machine](http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Sales-Machine-Turbocharge-Relentless/dp/1591842158/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253297041&sr=1-1&tag=ensolinc-20) - This book builds on the idea of [E-Myth](http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Sales-Machine-Turbocharge-Relentless/dp/1591842158/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253297041&sr=1-1&tag=ensolinc-20) by Michael Gerber in creating a system for a performing company. In it, there is a short, simple chapter on productivity. The basic gist is that before you start every day, you outline what tasks you want to complete and then assign timeboxes to each task.
* [The Four Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253297213&sr=1-2&tag=ensolinc-20) - I've tried to implement a lot of the stuff Tim Ferris outlines, but outsourcing to date has been more work for me than it has been worth. I do try to be on an information diet and I'm a firm proponent of the 80/20 principle, however.

My mix basically translates to Getting Things Done + Daily Tasks. I use [Things.app](http://culturedcode.com/things/) to do project planning on a weekly basis. Every day, I select or create approximately 6 tasks I need to complete for the day and mark them as "Today" in Things.app. I schedule them out and order them sequentially. I use [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) and a handy AppleScript I've modified (<a href="http://www.enlightsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/gtd.applescript.txt" title="gtd.applescript.txt">gtd.applescript.txt</a>) so my withstanding daily tasks are always in my face on my desktop. I'd really like to have it as a dashboard widget too, but I haven't taken the time to look for one just yet.

Any system you use requires relentless discipline. It's really easy to fall off the productivity wagon. Don't use a system just because it's the latest fad - use it because you want to be more effective at what you do.


How do you get things done? I love to nerd out about productivity tips so let me know what works for you!
