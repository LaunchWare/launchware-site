I was looking for a quick, free photo editor for Mac OS X. IPhoto is just horrible.

I found a decent program from BeLight Software called <a title="Image Tricks" href="http://www.belightsoft.com/products/imagetricks/overview.php">Image Tricks</a>. I really just needed something that will crop and resize, so this program fits the bill.
