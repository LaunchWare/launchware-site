* [Bezos on Business and Zappos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hxX_Q5CnaA) - A MUST WATCH - this was perhaps the highlight of my week courtesy of [The Ted](https://twitter.com/tedbowman). I think Jeff really nails it on what makes businesses so successful today: you must obsess over your customers. I just found the talk really inspiring and informative. Take the 8 minutes to watch and learn from one of the best entrepreneurs of our time.
* [IShowU.app](https://store.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html) - This looks like great screencasting software. Screencasts are an effective way to show your users what they can do with your application. They're also [becoming](https://www.envycasts.com) [quite](https://www.peepcode.com) [popular](https://www.railscasts.com) [learning](https://www.pragprog.com/screencasts) [tools](https://gitcasts.com/) for developers.
* [DHH Talks to FLOSS](https://www.twit.tv/floss79) - David Heinemeier Hansson talks on a popular and well-produced podcast on how he got into development. He talks a lot about development mentalities and the need for establishing conventions. While I don't always agree with David, I related to him in a lot of ways specifically around his business motivations overpowering his development aspirations. I found it really interesting.
* [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com) - I've been waiting for something like this for a very long while. Affordable, simple and effective usability testing really is just about observing user behaviors and listening to what they're saying as they navigate. I haven't tried this service yet, but I plan to do so in the near future.
