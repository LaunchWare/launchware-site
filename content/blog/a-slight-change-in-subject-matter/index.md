<p>Sorry there's been a void of posts here. My career has been changing very rapidly. I've become a part of a <a href="http://www.secondrotation.com">great company</a>, and I'm looking forward to pursuing the opportunity there. There is extreme potential both in the business model and in my ability to grow and learn. I've recently been tasked with managing the software development process and with leading a great team.</p>

<p>With that, it is time to take a look at the subject matter of this blog. I'm hoping to gear my content more towards my daily experience as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Software Developer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management">Project Manager</a> in a startup rather than freelance development and entrepreneurship. I hope you'll enjoy the small shift in focus as I learn along the way. As always, your feedback and input is what makes this a discussion rather than a monologue. I hope we can all learn from each other's experience here.</p>
