The first issue of [Rails Magazine](http://railsmagazine.com/) has been published. It looks like there is a lot of great content from some great authors.<a href="http://www.railsmagazine.com"><img src="http://www.enlightsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0991c5b2-d79e-4187-9adf-c099aa015d4e.jpg" alt="Rails Magazine" border="0" width="128" height="128" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px" /></a>

I wrote an article about my switch from [RSpec](http://www.rspec.info) to [Shoulda](http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda). A lot of issues I discussed have been addressed by both teams. Please [participate](http://railsmagazine.com/forums/2/topics/22) in the discussion about the latest development in test frameworks.

I think it's really cool that Rails now has a publication. Props to [Olimpiu](http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/15666-olimpiu-metiu) for putting it together.
