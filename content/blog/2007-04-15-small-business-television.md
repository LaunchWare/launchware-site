While doing some research on PEO's, I came across <a href="http://www.enlightsolutions.com/www.sbtv.com">SBTV</a> (Small Business TV). There seems to be lots of relevant content for small business owners. I'll definitely be checking it out weekly.

Low and behold, I found some <a href="http://www.sbtv.com/michaelgerber/">Michael Gerber</a> videos to feed the brain with. You might know him as the author of the must read book <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0887307280/ref=s9_asin_image_1-hf_favarsnfggenpx_2267_g1/103-9775158-6167812?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=173HAR8N2WQ89RXC7YZE&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=278240301&pf_rd_i=507846http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0887307280/ref=s9_asin_image_1-hf_favarsnfggenpx_2267_g1/103-9775158-6167812?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=173HAR8N2WQ89RXC7YZE&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=278240301&pf_rd_i=507846"><em>E-Myth</em></a><em>.</em>
It definitely looks like a great resource. I hope you find it helpful.
