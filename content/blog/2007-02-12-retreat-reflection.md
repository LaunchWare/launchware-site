So I've been so busy I haven't been able to post about how my retreat went 2 weeks ago. It went really well, but I did fall short on my objectives. Here's a brief overview of what panned out.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Objective 1: </strong>Determine what type of business I want to build - what are its ideals, its mission, and product?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Honest, Simple, Practical - these are the 3 main descriptors I want our customers to use when they're referring to the way we do business</li>
	<li>We make running small to mid sized businesses and organizations easier. We'll try to find proven and practical software to meet your needs - if we can't find it, we'll build it.</li>
	<li>Initially, Enlight Solutions will sell expertise in Information Technology and Software Development. We'll eventually break into a Software as a Service (SaaS) model offering all small and mid sized businesses affordable solutions that make good business sense.</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Objective 2: </strong>Determine action steps - what will it take for me to get there? Who will I have to meet? How will I meet them?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Develop long-term relationships with quality customers</li>
<ul>
	<li>Regularly attend networking events</li>
	<li>Maintain existent relationships</li>
</ul>
	<li>Find a mentor</li>
	<li>Develop a proof of concept to create buzz</li>
	<li>Save at least 3 months worth of a salary</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Objective 3:</strong> Develop a rough business plan</li>
	<li><strong>Objective 4: </strong>Develop a rough sales plan</li>
</ul>
This all needs a bit of refinement but you get the general idea. I didn't really get to tackle Object 3 and 4 as I got sidetracked brainstorming on a proof of concept. I want to build something out that works great for all small businesses. I came up with triptracker.biz - track your business mileage for tax purposes and travel reimbursement. It's a really cool concept and I'm looking forward to building it out. I tried to think of a tool that everyone in a small business could use, and I definitely think this falls in that category.
