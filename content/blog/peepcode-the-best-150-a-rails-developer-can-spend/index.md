Most Rails developers know of [PeepCode](https://www.peepcode.com) but I know only a few that have actually purchased a screencast from them. I'm really happy that they've reintroduced their [year subscription](https://peepcode.com/products/unlimited). There's no excuse now - go and buy this! After watching two or three I can say it's already paid for itself.

Interestingly, I'm enjoying the pdf's just as much as the screencasts. Keep it up PeepCode!

If you're a cheapskate, start out over at [RailsCasts](https://www.railscasts.com) - but if you like them, help Ryan out and buy some PeepCode material.
