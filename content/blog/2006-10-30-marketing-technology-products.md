<a title="Guy Kawasaki" href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> had some very <a title="Geek Marketing" href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/10/geek_marketing_.html">profound pointers</a> when it comes to technology marketing these days. Remember <a title="Geek Isn't Good Enough" href="http://blog.enlightsolutions.com/geek-isnt-good-enough/">Geek is not Good Enough</a>? This is exactly what Guy is talking about here (particularly in point #2). What sells technology is what it implies for business. If you want to successfully market your product, you have to speak the language of business before  you speak geek.

Build a business case. Show the cost savings or the potential for profit increase when you're talking to your customer. More often than not, the person that's making the decision to buy isn't going to care about what platform you build your technology on. Justify the expenditure in dollars and cents. Sales is not convincing your customer that you're technically savvy (although it may help), it's ultimately showing your customer how your product can improve the way they do business.
