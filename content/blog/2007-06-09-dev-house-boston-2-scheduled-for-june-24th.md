Well its that time of year again. <a href="http://devboston.pbwiki.com/">Dev House Boston</a> is now open for registration. Last <a href="http://www.enlightsolutions.com/articles/devhouse-boston/">year</a>, I helped a team build a component that searches Amazon for album information via web services. Of course, we built it with Ruby on Rails.

It was a lot of fun and it was great to meet some local developers. If you have a project you'd like to hack around with, I highly suggest checking this event out. I'll probably be messing around with some online shopping cart integration to start one of my e-commerce ideas (<a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> anyone?). Its a great day, so come on out and meet, greet, code, and learn.
