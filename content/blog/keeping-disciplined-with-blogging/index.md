How do you do it? Do you prioritize it over other business activities? I was struggling with consistently getting good posts up - especially when I was going through my retreat. There was so much creativity going on I didn't want to stop the momentum.
I have now set aside two hours a week to review other people's blogs and to write at least one post. I will let you know how it works out, but I really want to hear about how you handle blogging.

It can get chaotic as an entrepreneur and time is an extremely valuable asset - how much do you devote to blogging and why?
