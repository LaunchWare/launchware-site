So BarCamp Boston 2 is set for March 17th in Cambridge. I presented a Ruby on Rails talk at BarCamp Manchester a few month back, but <a href="http://www.rajivmanglani.com/">Rajiv</a> is already doing a talk on that next month.

There's so much out there in terms of what to talk about. I was thinking about doing a talk on marketing - but I'm not a marketer - in fact I'm developing my sales and marketing skills through <a href="http://baselineselling.com/">reading</a>. I figured it would be a good exercise to actually go through a presentation on it.

What about development tools? I was thinking about selecting a few tools like <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2079/">SeleniumIDE</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">FireBug</a> and doing a presentation on how they make me a better developer.

One of my other ideas was presenting on the rise of new web design patterns. Tagging interfaces, modal dialogs, expanding/collapsing menus, etc. I could also touch upon using these patterns and AJAX <em>practically</em> instead of the rising problem of overuse.

All kinds of great things to talk about, but no real compelling topic. Any thoughts?
