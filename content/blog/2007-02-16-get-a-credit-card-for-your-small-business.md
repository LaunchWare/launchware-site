I found a great <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/consumer/index.cfm?story=smallbizcards">article</a> on obtaining a small business credit card. I was always been concerned that credit cards that I've held in previous companies affected my personal credit. This article explains how the whole process works.

It's really interesting that there were separate credit agencies established strictly for business credit. I registered at <a href="http://www.dnb.com/us/">Dun & Bradstreet</a> but I could not find a registration process for <a href="http://www.businesscreditusa.com/">Business Credit USA</a> (maybe they could utilize some web development services?).

I am currently looking at a credit line with my local bank. How are you handling your business' short term credit?
