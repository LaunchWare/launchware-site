Happy Friday! This week's enlightenment brought you by the lovely JavaScript framework [JQuery](http://www.jquery.com). If you like unobtrusive and functional javascript utilities, you really have to check it out. A while ago, I converted from [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and haven't looked back. I even built a plugin to help with our development process called [under_construction](http://dpickett.github.com/under_construction/demo.html). Use it to overlay or hide elements of page that haven't been implemented yet.

* [Achieving Rounded Corners in Internet Explorer for jQuery UI with DD_roundies](http://gyazo.com/2b928dda1b3a2ce3728419a1497e7cef.png) - this was an effective technique for getting rounded corners to be respected in Internet Explorer. I used the DD_roundies library in conjunction with the [rounded corners](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/corners) plugin
* [Tips for Writing Better JQuery Code](http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/08/04/10-tips-for-writing-better-jquery-code/) - loaded with great tips on optimizing your javascript
* [Write Desktop and Mobile Apps with Bowline](http://leadthinking.com/191-bowline-a-ruby-gui-framework) - I played around with this a few days ago and I really like it. If you consider yourself well versed in Rails, HTML, and JQuery, I highly recommend you check this framework out. I'm hashing out a few OS X applications without a single reference to NSWindow - crazy!
* [Have google load JQuery for you](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/) - this has made it into my upcoming Rails Template - save on bandwidth costs and get snappy delivery of your javascript libraries via Google's Content Delivery Network

On an off topic note, I've been using [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard) and [Concentrate.app](http://getconcentrating.com/) to help maintain productivity. A blog post on Concentrate.app is forthcoming
