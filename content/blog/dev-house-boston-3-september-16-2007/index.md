<a href="https://devboston.pbwiki.com/">Dev House Boston 3</a> is now open for registration. Last <a href="https://www.enlightsolutions.com/articles/devhouse-boston/">year</a>, I helped a team build a component that searches Amazon for album information via web services. Of course, we built it with Ruby on Rails.

It was a lot of fun and it was great to meet some local developers. If you have a project you'd like to hack around with, I highly suggest checking this event out. I want to mess around with some API's - maybe EBay, Shopping.com, or Amazon. I definitely want to create some kind of Facebook app, so we'll see who's interested in that idea.
