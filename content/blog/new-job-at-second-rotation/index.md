So I haven't had an opportunity to write in a while because I've taken a new full time position with a startup in Waltham, MA. The job entails architecting and developing a series of applications that are very exciting.

I figured - what's the best way to learn about having my own startup? I decided to join one with a solid team and a great idea. I'm really excited about the engagement, and for the past two weeks, I've been able to exert some real creativity and innovation. What's even better is that I've already witnessed examples of great leadership within the team, and there's so much to learn from my new colleagues.

I'll be sure to keep posting as the business develops.
