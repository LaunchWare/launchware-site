[Kyle](http://www.somedirection.com) [del.icio.us'ed](http://del.icio.us) me this [article](http://30sleeps.com/blog/2007/12/16/busy-vs-productive/) and I really dug it. [Work](http://www.secondrotation.com) has been really crazy lately - we've been ramping up development efforts so both coding and project management needs have increased. 

Have you ever asked yourself the question: __"Am I busy or productive?"__. I've been asking myself that lately. Sometimes, less is definitely more. In the [Agile Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) world, there's this whole idea of [sustainable pace](http://www.langrsoft.com/articles/sustainablePace.shtml).

How productive are you as a developer after 60 hour workweeks and a lack of sleep? Every good developer should know when quitting is actually more __productive__ than staying __busy__. If you're burning the midnight oil and making frequent mistakes give these ideas some thought:

* Am I introducing flawed code that is going to haunt me later? 
* If I'm observing many mistakes that I'm making, is it possible there's many more I'm not realizing?
* Am I really contributing to burndown/velocity effectively?

Know when to quit! Your team members and your supervisors will thank you.
