I just posted a quick page <a title="About Dan Pickett" href="http://blog.enlightsolutions.com/about-dan-pickett/">about me</a>. Thanks to <a title="Simon Clay Michael" href="http://isabont.wordpress.com/">Simon Clay Michael</a> for suggesting it. I realized it was quite silly to have a blog without any contact information on it.

I'll be looking to revamp the blog and the website in general soon. I've been working with <a title="Ejae Design" href="http://www.ejaedesign.com/index.php/journal">Jae Barclay</a> on Enlight Solutions' identity design. He's done a great job, and it was great working with him on these initial stages. Be sure to look out for a newly launched site soon!
