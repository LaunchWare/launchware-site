I spent last Saturday coding in Cambridge at the first <a href="http://devboston.pbwiki.com/">DevHouse Boston</a> event. Thanks to <a href="http://rura.org/blog/">Shimon Rura</a> for organizing and <a href="http://www.permabit.com/">Permabit</a> for hosting. It's where a bunch of developers in the Boston area get together and try to hack together applications in 10 hours. The event was a lot of fun. It's always great to work with my friend, <a title="Kyle Bradshaw" href="http://www.somedirection.com">Kyle Bradshaw</a>.

Kyle had a great idea - port an application called <a href="http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm">Tag & Rename</a> from Windows to OS X. He noticed there really isn't a great tool to clean up ID3 tags on your MP3's. Basically, ID3 tags are what identifies your MP3's - artist, song name, and album title. Coincidentally, he met Jeff Dlouhy who wrote an MP3 organizer named <a title="Corripio" href="http://nclasssoftware.com/index.php/nClassSoftware/corripio/">Corripio</a>. Eager to hone my Ruby programming ability and being indecisive about what project to take on, I took a look at a library called <a title="Ruby-Amazon" href="http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml">Ruby-Amazon</a>. Anyways, I was able to build a pretty nifty script that pulls down album information from Amazon's web services. Jeff's working on using it to implement the ID3 tag cleanup functionality.

All in all, it was a great time. Lots of smart people doing many interesting things. In particular, one group played around with <a title="Voice XML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML">VoiceXML</a> and it really peaked my interests. It's still young technology, but it has tremendous implications for automated answering services and voice recognition. It's definitely a framework worth taking a peak at.

If you're into reading source code - check out the <a href="http://blog.enlightsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/amazon.rb">Ruby script</a>.

If you're interested in cleaning your mp3 collection up on a Mac, be sure to check out <a title="Corripio" href="http://nclasssoftware.com/index.php/nClassSoftware/corripio/">Corripio</a>. Jeff has a bright future, and this program serves as a great example of his abilities to develop clean OS X apps.
