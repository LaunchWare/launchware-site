Do you find yourself checking your email when you should be coding? Reading Reddit while your test suite runs? Finally, comes an app that is off to a great start when it comes to focusing on the task you're performing. [Concentrate](https://getconcentrating.com/)!

You can set up profiles based on the context of your action. My contexts are set up as follows:

<h3>Away</h3>

* Sets [Skype](https://skype.com/) status to "Away"
* Sets [Adium](https://adium.im/) status to "Away"

<h3>Blogging</h3>
* Opens up [MarsEdit](https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/)
* Opens up [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - I often track blogging ideas there
* Closes my GMail [Prism](https://labs.mozilla.com/projects/prism/) Instance
* Closes [Tweetie](https://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/)
* Sets Adium status to Away as "Writing"
* Sets Skype Status to Away

<h3>Code</h3>
* Launches [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
* Launches [Gitx](https://gitx.frim.nl/)
* Launches [iTerm](https://iterm.sourceforge.net/)
* Launches [Lighthouse Keeper](https://www.mcubedsw.com/software/lighthousekeeper) - Bug Tracking
* Launches [PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) Prism Instance - Story/Feature Tracking
* Launches [Propane.app](https://propaneapp.com/) - Campfire Client
* Launches [RallyClock](https://rallyclock.com) Prism Instance - time tracking
* Closes Tweetie
* Closes GMail Prism Instance

* Opens [Rdoc.info](https://www.rdoc.info) in Firefox

<h3>GTD</h3>

Getting Things Done is a methodology for organizing tasks and projects. I practice it using the following workflow:

* Opens Firefox
* Opens Things.app
* Opens [VoodooPad](https://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) - my personal wiki
* Opens [Jott](https://jott.com/) in Firefox - when I'm on the road, I will call in actions as they pop into my head. Jott isn't great at transcribing my messages but I can re-listen to them when I'm doing my weekly review, etc.
* Opens my [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com) Dashboard - I use this to analyze productivity and see what apps I'm using heavily

<h3>Marketing</h3>
* Opens Firefox
* Opens Gmail Prism Instance
* Opens Tweetie
* Sets Adium Status to "Away"
* Opens [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) in Firefox
* Opens my [Fat Free CRM](https://fatfreecrm.com/) instance in Firefox
* Opens up the [WWR Forums](https://workingwithrails.com/forums) in Firefox

I will continue to refine this list and add to it. Having used it for over a week, I can say Concentrate.app has helped me become more efficient and focused when I need to switch contexts. There are some problems with it and [Vimperator](https://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator) I think, but overall it has become a de facto tool. I hope you find it useful!
