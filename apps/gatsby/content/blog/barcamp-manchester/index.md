I recently attended <a title="BarCamp Manchester" href="https://www.barcampmanchester.org/index.php/Main_Page">BarCamp Manchester</a>. It was my first BarCamp and it was an amazing experience. There were lots of interesting speakers and conversations. I presented a crash course on the <a title="Ruby On Rails" href="https://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails </a>Framework (my presentation can be downloaded <a title="Dan Pickett's RoR Presentation" href="https://blog.enlightsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/barcamppres.ppt">here</a>).

My favorite speaker was <a title="Ray Deck" href="https://www.raydeck.com/">Ray Deck</a>. He spoke about Startups and Marketing (his slides can be found <a title="Ray Deck's BarCamp Manchester Reflection" href="https://www.raydeck.com/2006/11/viva-manchvegas">here</a>). One of his very profound points is that there are 3 things necessary for a successful business model: customers, their need, and a solution that satisfies the need. The cool part of this he helped us realize - your solution is only 1/3 of the equation. Often, I think having cool technology can fool us into thinking that a market is there when it's not. You have to have the other two pieces of the pie. Without a customer and what Guy Kawasaki describes as "pain" (a need), you will not succeed in the business world. You have to have all three elements for a successful business model.

Thanks to <a title="Tom" href="https://www.yoparts.com/">Tom</a> for pointing me to the event. Also, it was a great time and many thanks to <a title="Ian Muir" href="https://ian.sundermedia.com/">Ian Muir</a> and the rest for putting together an awesome event. I'm definitely looking forward to future BarCamps in both Manchester and Boston.
