Goodbye [exception_notifier](https://github.com/rails/exception_notification/tree/master) and a cluttered inbox! Kudos to [Thoughtbot](https://www.thoughtbot.com) for rolling out [hoptoad](https://www.hoptoadapp.com): the app error app. It's a web service that your app can talk to in order to report 500 (server) errors.

It was a snap to configure and has a simple plugin you can download once you register. You can add hooks to Lighthouse or other bug tracking software. Not sure how to do this yet, but it's awesome to see a great execution on an app that solves a problem.
