Enlight's own development partner, [Jonathan Follett](https://www.hotknifedesign.com), will be presenting his thoughts at an upcoming [New England Web Developers' Association Meeting in Hudson, MA](https://www.newda.org/?page_id=20). He'll be speaking about how we utilize web tools to build virtual teams on Wednesday, March 25th @ 7pm in Hudson, MA.

Having worked with Jon, and after reading his [articles](https://www.alistapart.com/authors/f/jonathanfollett/) at [A List Apart](https://www.alistapart.com), I can say it will be an interesting and informative talk. Working with Jon and Hot Knife Design has been a great experience. He brings great creative leadership to virtual teams.
