I was pleasantly surprised last week when I was at a <a href="https://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/2007/11/14/webinno-small-group-dinner-%e2%80%93-%e2%80%9cthe-secrets-of-social-network-platform-apps%e2%80%9d/">Boston Web Innovators Group session</a>. At the same <a href="https://www.classicirish.com/asgard_about.html">bar</a>, there was a consortium of various Northeastern user interface and user experience groups meeting. Of interest to me were <a href="https://upaboston.org/">UPA (Usability Professionals Association)</a> Boston,Â  and <a href="https://www.bostonchi.org/">Boston CHI</a>.

<a href="https://www.secondrotation.com/main/careers">Second Rotation</a> is still looking for front end developers, so I was initially intrigued. Regardless of our need for front end developers, these communities are really interesting to me. With local usability authorities like <a href="https://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug</a> (who I met briefly) as members, these communities have a lot of interest and value. If you're a web developer in the Boston area, I heartily recommend you check these groups out.
