Last night I spoke @ [Boston.rb](https://bostonrb.org) about everything that happens around code.

Lately, I've been heavily interested in discussing the process behind software development. Our field is still very young, and I think there's a lot we can do to improve the way in which we do our jobs.

Slides are below. I described the talk this way: We spend so much time focusing on conventional programming. Everyone focuses on standards, code clarity, testing, and what gems to use. Let's chat about what's done before your fingers hit the keys. Let's talk about brainstorming, requirements, stakeholders, mock-ups, and writing solid user stories and acceptance tests with Cucumber. Every project has a story - how will your next one end?

If you attended the talk, I would love your [feedback at SpeakerRate](https://speakerrate.com/talks/1781-it-s-not-just-about-code-boston-rb)
