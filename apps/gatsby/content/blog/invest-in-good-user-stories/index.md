As I work my way through
[_User Stories Applied_](https://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323305968&sr=8-1)
and begin to write my own for an upcoming project, I keep coming back to
[Bill Wake's](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/)
INVEST acronym.  It helps me get in the right mindset. A good user story is independent, negotiable, valuable,
estimatable, small, testable.  If it can meet all those requirements,
you've done a good job.

#### Independent ####
Stories that are independent make the whole development
process easier.  You don't have stories waiting for others to be
completed so estimation of development time becomes more precise.  Be
creative, sometimes stories can be combined or defined in a way to
decreases dependencies.

#### Negotiable ####
Stories help in the discovery and planning phase of a
project.  They facilitate the conversation between client and the
development team.  Remember to note high-level details and decisions
that are made in these meetings.

#### Valuable ####
Make sure each story provides value to either the purchaser
or user of the product.  This type of focus can help in the
proritization of stories.  Some clients are comfortable writing their
own stories and this can provide good insight into their vision of the
product.

#### Estimatable ####
If a story is not estimatable, it is usually too large or the development
team lacks the domain or technical knowledge necessary for an
estimation.  A conversation with the client can increase domain
understanding, while a developer can build technical understanding
before estimation.


#### Small ####
Small stories allow for the most accurate predictions.  If they are
too big or small, it is difficult to block out the correct about of
development time.  Combine or split stories to managable sizes.  Stories
can be split by user actions (separate create, edit, update stories).

#### Testable ####
A story is not complete until it can pass automated tests.  Non-functional or
overly subject requirements can lead to untestable conditions and should
be avoided.  As the code base evolves, you will continually use your
tests to ensure old stories are not broken.
