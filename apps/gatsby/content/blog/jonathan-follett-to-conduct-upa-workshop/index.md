Our design partner, [Jon Follett](https://www.hotknifedesign.com) will be conducting the workshop "Visual Design for Web Sites and Web Apps" for UPA Boston on
Saturday, August 01, 2009 from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM (ET). If you're a developer looking for some design orientation, I think this would be a great opportunity for you to gain some knowledge.

If you're a designer looking to refine your skills on the web, Jon is excellent at his craft in addition to being a great teacher.

So join in on the event. I'm sure you'll take some learnings home with you. [Registration](https://uxworkshop10.eventbrite.com/)
