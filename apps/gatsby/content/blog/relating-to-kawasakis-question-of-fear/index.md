In Guy Kawasaki's first chapter of "The Art of the Start" there was a question that I've really been asking myself the last few days.
<blockquote>"I admit it: I'm scared. I can't afford to quit my current job. Is that a sign that I don't have what it takes to succeed?"</blockquote>
I love Guy's response to this. He states:
<blockquote>"You should be scared. If you aren't scared something is wrong with you...You can reduce these fears by diving into the business and making a little progress each day"</blockquote>
While it made me feel good to read that how does it translate to how I'm starting? I've taken that response and tried to apply it to my business. Building a business takes significant time and energy. I'm really committing to stay the course here, and it can't be done overnight. From that, here's what I've come up with:
<ul>
	<li>Set tangible, realistic goals.</li>
	<li>Slow and steady wins the race. Develop the skills and build the network. Don't rush into a venture without the right amount of initial thought.</li>
	<li>Nothing goes as planned, but preparation helps. Have a vision but don't over commit to what's just an idea.</li>
</ul>
Easier said than done, right? I'm convinced that it's all about patience in a fast paced world that wants you to rush through things. A small amount of progress is still progress. Don't let the sheer mass of your business initiatives intimidate and overwhelm you into inaction.

I think I just motivated myself to make "a little progress" today.
