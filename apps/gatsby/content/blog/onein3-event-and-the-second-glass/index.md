A new friend invited me to a networking event in the North End sponsored by Mayor Menino's <a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/bra/betterboston/flash/flashhome.htm">OneIn3</a>. It was a great event at the Living Room - lots of younger people and cheap drinks :-). I met many interesting people.

One person of note was Tyler Balliet. He's publishing a really innovative wine magazine called <a title="The Second Glass" href="https://thesecondglass.com/">The Second Glass</a>. It takes the formality out of wine tasting and enjoying wine - I think something that my generation can really appreciate. If you're into wine with a sense of humor, I highly recommend checking out their site and magazine.
